title: Infinetly stuck in useEffect?
---

If you have used class-based components in React, you would probably be aware of the lifecycle methods. In functional React, a page is rendered if the state is changed. 


>you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.[More](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
